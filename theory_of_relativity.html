          When the theory of relativity appeared in the early 1900s, it upended
          centuries of science and gave physicists a new understanding of space
          and time. Isaac Newton saw space and time as fixed, but in the new
          picture provided by <b>special relativity and general relativity</b> they
          were fluid and malleable.

          <h3>Who came up with the theory of relativity?</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Albert Einstein</strong>. He published the first part of his theory — special
            relativity — in the German physics journal <em>Annalen der Physik</em> in
            1905 and completed his theory of general relativity only after
            another decade of difficult work. He presented the latter theory in
            a series of lectures in Berlin in late 1915 and published in the
            Annalen in 1916.

        <h4>What is special relativity?</h4>
        <p>The theory is based on two key concepts.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            First, the natural world allows no “privileged” frames of reference.
            As long as an object is moving in a straight line at a constant
            speed (that is, with no acceleration), the laws of physics are the
            same for everyone. It’s a bit like when you look out a train window
            and see an adjacent train appear to move — but <em>is it</em> moving, or <em>are
            you?</em> It can be hard to tell. Einstein recognized that if the motion
            is perfectly uniform, it's literally impossible to tell — and
            identified this as a central principle of physics.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Second, light travels at an unvarying speed of 186,000 miles a
            second. No matter how fast an observer is moving or how fast a
            light-emitting object is moving, a measurement of the <strong>speed of light</strong>
            always yields the same result.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Starting from these two postulates, Einstein showed that space and
          time are intertwined in ways that scientists had never previously
          realized. Through a series of thought experiments, Einstein
          demonstrated that the consequences of special relativity are often
          counterintuitive — even startling.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re zooming along in a rocket and pass a friend in an identical
          but slower-moving rocket, for example, you’ll see that your friend’s
          watch is ticking along more slowly than yours (physicists call this
          "time dilation").
        </p>
        <p>
          What’s more, your friend’s rocket will appear shorter than your own.
          If your rocket speeds up, your mass and that of the rocket will
          increase. The faster you go, the heavier things become and the more
          your rocket will resist your efforts to make it go faster. Einstein
          showed that  <strong>nothing that has a mass can ever reach the speed of light</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another consequence of special relativity is that matter and energy
          are interchangeable via the famous equation <kbd>E = mc²</kbd> (in
          which E stands for energy, m for mass, and c² the speed of light
          multiplied by itself). Because the speed of light is such a big
          number, even a tiny amount of mass is equivalent to — and can be
          converted into — a very large amount of energy. That’s why atomic and
          hydrogen bombs are so powerful.

        <h5>What is general relativity?</h5>
        <p>
          Essentially, it’s a theory of gravity. The basic idea is that instead
          of being an invisible force that attracts objects to one another,
          <strong>gravity is a curving or warping of space</strong>. The more massive an object,
          the more it warps the space around it.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, the sun is massive enough to warp space across our solar
          system — a bit like the way a heavy ball resting on a rubber sheet
          warps the sheet. As a result, Earth and the other planets move in
          curved paths (orbits) around it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This warping also affects measurements of time. We tend to think of
          time as ticking away at a steady rate. But just as gravity can stretch
          or warp space, it can also dilate time. If your friend climbs to the
          top of a mountain, you’ll see his clock ticking faster compared to
          yours; another friend, at the bottom of a valley, will have a
          slower-ticking clock, because of the difference in the strength of
          gravity at each place. Subsequent experiments proved that this indeed
          happens.

        <h6>What does relativity look like 'under the hood?'</h6>
        <p>
          Special relativity is ultimately a set of equations that relate the
          way things look in one frame of reference to how they look in another
          — the stretching of time and space, and the increase in mass. The
          equations involve nothing more complicated than high-school math.
        </p>
        <p>
          General relativity is more complicated. Its “field equations” describe
          the relationship between mass and the curvature of space and dilation
          of time, and are typically taught in graduate-level university physics
          courses.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="Tests">
        <span class="custom-head">Tests of special and general relativity</span>
        <p>
          Over the last century, many experiments have confirmed the validity of
          both special and general relativity. In the first major test of
          general relativity, astronomers in 1919 measured the  <strong>deflection of
            light from distant stars</strong> as the starlight passed by our sun, proving
          that gravity does, in fact, distort or curve space.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1971, scientists tested both parts of Einstein’s theory by placing
          precisely  <strong>synchronized atomic clocks in airliners and flying them
            around the world</strong>. A check of the timepieces after the planes landed
          showed that the clocks aboard the airliners were running a tiny bit
          slower than (less than one millionth of a second) than the clocks on
          the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          The disparity resulted from the speed of the planes (a special
          relativity effect) and their greater distance from the center of
          Earth’s gravitational field (a general relativity effect). In 2016,
          the  <strong>discovery of gravitational waves</strong> — subtle ripples in the fabric of
          spacetime — was another confirmation of general relativity.
        </p>

      <div class="practice">
        <span class="custom-head">Relativity in practice</span>
        <p>
          While the ideas behind relativity seem esoteric, the theory has had a
          huge impact on the modern world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons, for example, would be
          impossible without the knowledge that matter can be transformed into
          energy. And our GPS (global positioning system) satellite network
          needs to account for the subtle effects of both special and general
          relativity; if they didn’t, they’d give results that were off by
          several miles.
